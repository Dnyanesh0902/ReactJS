State : In React state refers to the data that changes within a component. state is an object that stores the components dynamic data 


State is necessary because react components are designed for reusability and dynamic, when a component  data changes, react will re render component to reflext the new data. state is used to keep track of the data and re render the component

How To Use State In functional components ?
Ans :- functional components are called stateless components because they cannot implement state directly so they use a hook called useState

import {useState} from 'react'

const [value, setValue] = useState(initialvalue)
value -- data which is printing on screen
setValue -- is a method to update state and re render the component
initial value contains default value
useState is a hook(function) provided by react


eg : -

import react,{useState} from 'react'
function Counter(){
const[count,setCount] = useState(0);
return(
	<div>
		<p> Count : {count} </p>
		<button  onClick={() => setCount(count+1)}>Increment </button>
	</div> 
	)
	}
export default counter;




ii. class components : class components are the stateful components and they use render method to render the UI and for render method they use component and extends it.
